The purpose of this project is to have a better understanding of how backend interacts with the frontend of a Full-Stack project. Please refer to https://github.com/Khemi1998/events-backend for the backend code.

<h2>Technologies 🧠</h2>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>springboot</li>

## ▫️◽️ Design ◽️▫️

The page has been deisgned with the mobile-first approach. The design has been based on a calendar. The user can see which days have events by the coloured days on the calendar. The user can then click on the day to see the events for that given day on the right hand-side. The option is given to the user to see all events on the 'toggle' button where the user can search and delete specific events. The left side-hand has a form where the user can add events to the calendar.

## ◾️◼️ Future Improvements ◼️◾️

At the moment, the Full-Stack project works when the react-app, springboot, and mySql are activated on local server. I plan to move the database and springboot code to google cloud.

## Psuedo Code ✍️
<ul>
  <li>Create endpoints using arraylists in SpringBoot</li>
  <li>Test endpoints on PostMan</li>
  <li>Replace arraylists with repository linked to mySql database</li>
  <li>Connect react-app to springboot with fetch</li>
  <li>Style react-app</li>
</ul>
